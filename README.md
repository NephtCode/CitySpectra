# CitySpectra: Interactive Web Application

## About

Welcome to CityGuide, a dynamic web application built as a mini assignment for the Applications and Web Technologies course at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. The project primarily utilizes HTML and CSS technologies, enhanced with JavaScript functionalities, provided by JSDOM, to enrich the user experience. The theme of the application is city-centric, geared to provide engaging and informational content about the world's most famous cities to tourists planning their future travel.

## Design Philosophy

The design of the application harmonizes the stark contrast of black, yellow, and white, embodying the eclectic spirit of modern cities. This aesthetic can be appreciated in detail within the .css files. The application also employs media queries to ensure a responsive design across a broad range of devices, enhancing accessibility and usability.

## Application Navigation

The entry point to the application is the `index` page. From there, users can navigate to the `about` page to understand more about the project. The `cities` page can be accessed from either the `index` or `about` page. This page presents the user with information about a preselected city (New York, by default). Users can interact with the page, selecting different city buttons to explore information about other cities.

## Functionalities

The JavaScript functionality of the buttons is driven by a script located in `script.js` in the `js` directory. We have employed JSDOM to enable this interaction, providing an intuitive and engaging interface for users.

The application leverages the power of Flexbox to display the city cards on the main page, enabling a flexible and responsive layout that adjusts to the user's screen size and device.

We invite you to explore CityGuide, where the world's greatest cities are just a click away!
